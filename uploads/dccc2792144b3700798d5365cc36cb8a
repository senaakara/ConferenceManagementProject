 Hey Comrade, 
 While it's loading, read our guide (https://dev.marblism.com/workspace) to learn how to prompt the AI to make on-the-fly changes. 
 The AI might have its quirks, so you're expected to do some coding as well! 
 If you have any problems, join our Discord (https://discord.gg/GScNz7kAEu). We reply fast.
